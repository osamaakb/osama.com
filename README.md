# Intro
This is a personal projcet for my website, this repo is public to help beginners starting with react or next js by taking a look at the code with the readme files I've added to each folder

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## To Start the project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
